yLib Service Framework
======================

The _yLib Service Framework_ is a set of class libraries and applications
intended for professional server application development under
Windows NT/Windows 2000.

It was developed around 1998-2000 for Windows NT and was used in various
commercial server applications.

The original version was hosted and maintained on SourceForge. The development
was discontinued many years ago. The original CVS repository from SourceForge
was converted to git by using [cvs2git](http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2git.html)
